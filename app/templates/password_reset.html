<p>Since the password reset links expire after a day, I have sent a new one - if this does not work, you can go to the <a href="http://input.joshcai.com">website</a> and click on the "Forgot Password?" link.</p>
{% endif %}

  Hi {{ user.name }}, please click
  <a href="{{ url }}">here</a> to set your password.
</p>

<p>Your login email is: {{ user.email }}</p>

<p>If the link was not clickable, copy and paste this into your browser:</p>

<p>{{url}}

<p>Thanks!</p>
